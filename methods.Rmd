The goal of this project is to produce a maximally sampled global fern phylogeny.

All DNA sequence data were downloaded from GenBank. The current FTOL (v1.0.0) includes sequences up to 2021-12-31.

Two datasets were produced:

- The "plastome" dataset includes `r dplyr::n_distinct(ftolr::plastome_parts$locus)` loci obtained from whole plastomes for `r nrow(plastome_data)` species (including outgroup taxa).

- The "Sanger" dataset includes `r dplyr::n_distinct(ftolr::sanger_parts$locus)` plastid loci for `r nrow(sanger_data) |> scales::number(big.mark = ",")` species (including outgroup taxa).

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using maximum likelihood in IQ-TREE [@Nguyen2015] in two steps. First, a backbone phylogeny was built using the plastome dataset. Next, the full phylogeny was built using the Sanger dataset with the backbone phylogeny as a constraint tree. For both analyses, all loci were concatenated and no partitioning was used.

The tree was dated using treePL [@Smith2012] with a set of `r dplyr::n_distinct(ftolr::con_fossils$n_fos)` [fossil constraints](https://github.com/fernphy/ferncal) (not including the root).
