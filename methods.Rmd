The goal of this project is to produce a maximally sampled global fern phylogeny.

All DNA sequence data were downloaded from GenBank. The current FTOL (v0.0.2) includes sequences from \_\_ to \_\_.

Two datasets were produced:

- The "plastome" dataset includes 79 loci obtained from whole plastomes for \_\_ species.
- The "Sanger" dataset includes seven plastid loci for \_\_ species.

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using maximum likelihood in IQ-TREE [@Nguyen2015] in two steps. First, a backbone phylogeny was built using the plastome dataset. Next, the full phylogeny was built using the Sanger dataset with the backbone phylogeny as a constraint tree. For both analyses, all loci were concatenated and no partitioning was used.

The tree was dated using treePL [@Smith2012] with a set of \_\_ fossil constraints.
