FTOL is available in several flavors:

- The maximum likelihood (ML) tree has branchlengths in units of expected genetic change per site and is fully bifurcating.
- The consensus tree is the majority-rule consensus of the bootstrap trees, and may include polytomies. 
- The dated tree has branchlengths in units of time (Ma) and is ultrametric.
- The backbone ML tree only includes species that have complete plastome sequences available.

All trees are rooted on bryophytes and include outgroup taxa. Node labels are bootstrap support values (%) measured with ultra-fast bootstrap [@Hoang2018].

All trees are in [Newick format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format).

For more options (rooting, inclusion of outgroup, etc.), use the `ftolr` R package.
