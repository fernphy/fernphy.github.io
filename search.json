    "text": "For a full description of methods, see Nitta et al. (2022).\nThe goal of this project is to produce a maximally sampled global fern phylogeny.\nAll DNA sequence data were downloaded from GenBank. The current FTOL (v1.4.0) includes sequences up to 2022-12-15 (GenBank release 253).\nInput data, including a database containing fern sequences from GenBank release 253, are available on FigShare.\nTwo datasets were produced:\n\nThe “plastome” dataset includes 79 loci obtained from whole plastomes for 528 species (including outgroup taxa).\nThe “Sanger” dataset includes 7 plastid loci for 5,704 species (including outgroup taxa).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was carried out using maximum likelihood in IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015) in two steps. First, a backbone phylogeny was built using the plastome dataset. Next, the full phylogeny was built using the Sanger dataset with the backbone phylogeny as a constraint tree. For both analyses, all loci were concatenated and no partitioning was used.\nThe tree was dated using treePL (Smith and O’Meara 2012) with a set of 53 fossil constraints (not including the root).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nNguyen, Lam-Tung, Heiko A.
