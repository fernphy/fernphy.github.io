    "text": "FTOL is available in several flavors:\n\nThe maximum likelihood (ML) tree has branchlengths in units of expected genetic change per site.\nThe consensus tree is the extended majority-rule consensus of the bootstrap trees, with units in expected genetic change per site.\nThe dated tree has branchlengths in units of time (Ma) and is ultrametric.\nThe backbone ML tree only includes species that have complete plastome sequences available.\n\nAll trees are rooted on algae (Zygnema) and include outgroup taxa, but Zygnema has been pruned from the dated trees. Node labels are bootstrap support values (%) measured with ultra-fast bootstrap (Hoang et al. 2018).\nAll trees are in Newick format.\n\n\n\nThe tree files are provided as part of a data archive (zip or tar.gz format).\nOther files in the archive include DNA sequence alignments, GenBank accession numbers, and fossil calibration points.\nAll files are described in the README.txt file contained within the archive."

    "text": "For a full description of methods, see Nitta et al. (2022).\nThe goal of this project is to produce a maximally sampled global fern phylogeny.\nAll DNA sequence data were downloaded from GenBank. The current FTOL (v1.2.1) includes sequences up to 2022-08-15 (GenBank release 251).\nInput data, including a database containing fern sequences from GenBank release 251, are available on FigShare.\nTwo datasets were produced:\n\nThe “plastome” dataset includes 79 loci obtained from whole plastomes for 498 species (including outgroup taxa).\nThe “Sanger” dataset includes 7 plastid loci for 5,608 species (including outgroup taxa).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was carried out using maximum likelihood in IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015) in two steps. First, a backbone phylogeny was built using the plastome dataset. Next, the full phylogeny was built using the Sanger dataset with the backbone phylogeny as a constraint tree. For both analyses, all loci were concatenated and no partitioning was used.\nThe tree was dated using treePL (Smith and O’Meara 2012) with a set of 54 fossil constraints (not including the root).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nNguyen, Lam-Tung, Heiko A.
